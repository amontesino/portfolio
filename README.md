# Portfolio Site

This site displays my work, both past and current, and is built with React and packaged by Vite.

## Planned features

The site is currently minimal, but is functional in its purpose to both reach me for contact and display my projects. However, I am still planning to port some prior projects to React and have them display natively within the site, rather than linking to other sites.

## TO-DO

- [X] Animated Router Transitions
- [ ] Hamburger Menu
- [ ] Project Explanation Block when project is clicked
- [ ] Light/Dark Mode Toggle
- [ ] React ReFactors of Older Projects

## Utilized frameworks/libraries

- React (of course!)

- React Router

- Font Awesome

- EmailJS
