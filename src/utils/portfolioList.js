Since then, I have refactored the project from vanilla JavaScript to the React framework, along with redefining CSS to have rules better aligning assets in the movie container, as well as responsive design for mobile layouts. This refactor re-taught me a lot about using Promise objects to make sure one Fetch function runs after the other is complete, and it also reminded me of the great importance that is error logging to pin down where exactly an app breaks.",
